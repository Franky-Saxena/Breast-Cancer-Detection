# Breast Cancer Detection

It is a project in which we did the analysis on the dataset of the breast cancer which is created by the Dr. William H. Wolberg(physician), University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Madison, Wisconsin, USA.

In this dataset each of the features is having the values which of range 1-10 and class is having two values 2 and 4 (Benign(Non Cancerous) and Malignant(Cancerous))

In this project we've tested:
* KNeighbors Classifier
* Support Vector Machine

```And Both of them is having 98% predicting accuracy.```

## To See Analyse of the data
run a jupyter notebook
```
run a BreastCancerProject.ipynb
```
## Deployment
Prepare your dataset:
```
1. Data Extraction
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building and Tuning
5. Pushing code to Github
```
